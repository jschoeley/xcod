With XCOD you can estimate time series of expected and excess deaths by cause. After fitting XCOD to the data and learning the cause-specific trends and seasonalities as well as residual dependencies across causes you can use XCOD to extrapolate the trends and simulate time series of cause specific expected deaths. Various excess death statistics (P-score, absolute excess deaths, mortality ratio) can be calculated along with associated prediction intervals and p-values.

## Model overview

The central idea is to model total expected deaths and expected death proportions across causes separately and to derive expected deaths by cause by multiplying the predicted proportions with the total. An advantage of the compositional/CoDa (Pawlowsky-Glahn Buccianti, 2011) approach is that sums of cause-specific expected deaths will be coherent with the expected totals and, by choosing an appropriate model for the totals, they too can be made coherent with previously published estimates. Compositional/CoDa techniques for forecasts of death by cause have been pioneered by Oeppen (2008) and Kjaergaard etal. (2019).

After fitting the model to the data and learning the cause-specific trends and seasonalities as well as residual dependencies across causes we extrapolate the trends and simulate time series of cause specific expected deaths which are then used in the calculation of excess death statistics by cause.

The method described below has been implemented in R as the "XCOD" routine (Schöley, 2024).

## Model specification

A vector of death counts by cause $j = 1, \ldots, k$ at time $t$, $\mathbf{D}^{(j)}_t = (D_t^1, \ldots, D_t^k)$, is modeled as the product of total expected deaths, $\lambda_t$, and a vector of cause-specific expected proportions on all deaths, $\mathbf{p}^{(j)}_t = (p^1_t, \ldots, p^k_t)$,

$$
\mathbf{D}^{(j)}_t = \lambda_t\mathbf{p}^{(j)}_t \times \exp \left( \mathbf{U}_t^{(j)}\right),
$$

with  $\mathbf{U}^{(j)}_t = (U^1_t, \ldots, U^k_t)$ being a vector of multivariate-normal distributed residuals, $\mathbf{U}_t \sim \mathcal{N}_k(0, \mathbf{\Sigma}_k)$, capturing the dependencies across causes of death. The exponent and multiplication are element wise.

In order to achieve robust and speedy estimates the data is fitted in a three-step procedure.

First, the expected total deaths at time t, $\lambda_t$, are fitted via Poisson regression as a log-linear function of time, featuring both a long-term trend and a cyclical seasonal component:

$$
\lambda_t = \exp \left( \beta_0 + g(t; \boldsymbol{\beta}_t) + s(t; T, \boldsymbol{\beta}_s) \right),
$$

where $g(t; \boldsymbol{\beta}_t)$ is a function of time modeling the long term trend, and $s(t; \boldsymbol{\beta}_s)$ is a cyclical function of time $t$ with period $T$ to capture seasonality.

Second, compositional regressions are fitted to estimate the expected proportion of cause-specific deaths on all deaths. Specifically, the cause-specific proportions, transformed via the centered-log-ratio (Pawlowsky-Glahn Buccianti, 2011), are expressed as a linear function of time,

$$
\mathrm{clr}_j(p^{j}_t) = \gamma_0^j + g(t; \boldsymbol{\gamma}_t) + s(t; T, \boldsymbol{\gamma}_s^j),
$$

with $p^{j}_t$ being the $j^\textrm{th}$ element of $\mathbf{p}_t$ and $\mathrm{clr}_j = \left( \frac {p^j_t} {G(\mathbf{p}_t)} \right)$, where $G(\mathbf{p}_t) = \sqrt[k]{\prod^k p^j_t}$ is the geometric mean over the proportions at a given time. The regressions are fitted via least-squares to the observed proportions.

Third, the residual covariance across causes of death, $\mathbf{\Sigma}_k$, is estimated from the within-sample model residuals, $\mathbf{U}_t = \log D_t - \log ( \hat\lambda_t\mathbf{\hat p}^{(j)}_t )$.

Simulated expected deaths by cause are drawn from the quantized predictive distribution of the fitted model:

$$
\mathbf{D}^{\mathrm{sim}(j)}_t = \left\lfloor \hat\lambda_t\mathbf{\hat p}^{(j)}_t \times \exp \left( \mathbf{U}_t^{\mathrm{sim}(j)}\right) \right\rfloor,
$$

where

$$
\mathbf{U}_t^{\mathrm{sim}(j)} \sim \mathcal{N}_k(0, \mathbf{\hat\Sigma}_k).
$$

## Excess death derivation

Samples of expected deaths, $\mathbf{D}^{\mathrm{sim}(j)}_t$, are the basis for samples of excess death estimates. We define the P-score for cause $j$ at time $t$ as the percent difference between the observed deaths and the deaths simulated under the expected distribution:

$$
\mathrm{Pscore}^{\mathrm{sim},j}_t = \frac {D^{\mathrm{obs},j}_t - D^{\mathrm{sim},j}_t} {D^{\mathrm{sim},j}_t}.
$$

The cumulative P-score over the interval $(a, b)$ is defined as

$$
\mathrm{Pscore}^{\mathrm{sim},j}_{(a,b)} = \frac {\sum_{t=a}^b (D^{\mathrm{obs},j}_t - D^{\mathrm{sim},j}_t)} {\sum_{t=a}^b D^{\mathrm{sim},j}_t}.
$$

Likewise the (cumulative) absolute excess deaths for cause $j$ at time $t$ are simulated as

$$
\mathrm{Excess}^{\mathrm{sim},j}_t = D^{\mathrm{obs},j}_t - D^{\mathrm{sim},j}_t,
$$

and

$$
\mathrm{Excess}^{\mathrm{sim},j}_{(a,b)} = \sum_{t=a}^b (D^{\mathrm{obs},j}_t - D^{\mathrm{sim},j}_t).
$$
